**OpenLIT** is an **OpenTelemetry-native** tool designed to help developers gain insights into the performance of their LLM applications in production. It automatically collects LLM input and output metadata, and monitors GPU performance for self-hosted LLMs.

OpenLIT makes integrating observability into GenAI projects effortless with just **a single line of code**. Whether you're working with popular LLM providers such as OpenAI and HuggingFace, or leveraging vector databases like ChromaDB, OpenLIT ensures your applications are monitored seamlessly, providing critical insights including GPU performance stats for self-hosted LLMs to improve performance and reliability.

This project proudly follows the [Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/main/docs/gen-ai) of the OpenTelemetry community, consistently updating to align with the latest standards in observability.

## What is LIT?
`LIT` stands for **Learning and Inference Tool**, which is a visual and interactive tool designed for understanding AI models and visualizing data. The term `LIT` was introduced by [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#learning-interpretability-tool-lit).

## ‚ö° Features
- **Advanced Monitoring of LLM and VectorDB Performance**: OpenLIT offers automatic instrumentation that generates traces and metrics, providing insights into the performance and costs of your LLM and VectorDB usage. This helps you analyze how your applications perform in different environments, such as production, enabling you to optimize resource ussage and scale efficiently.
- **Cost Tracking for Custom and Fine-Tuned Models**: OpenLIT enables you to tailor cost tracking for specific models by using a custom JSON file. This feature allows for precise budgeting and ensures that cost estimations are perfectly aligned with your project needs.
- **OpenTelemetry-native & vendor-neutral SDKs**: OpenLIT is built with native support for OpenTelemetry, making it blend seamlessly with your projects. This vendor-neutral approach reduces barriers to integration, making OpenLIT an intuitive part of your software stack rather than an additional complexity.

            OpenLIT_UI[OpenLIT UI] -->|Pulls Data| ClickHouseDB;
        end
    end
```

### Step 1: Deploy OpenLIT Stack

1. Git Clone OpenLIT Repository
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:openlit/openlit.git
   ```

2. Start Docker Compose
   ```shell
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Step 2: Install OpenLIT SDK

Open your command line or terminal and run:

```bash
pip install openlit
```

### Step 3: Initialize OpenLIT in your Application
Integrating OpenLIT into LLM applications is straightforward. Start monitoring for your LLM Application with just **two lines of code**: 

```python
import openlit

openlit.init()
```

To forward telemetry data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint, such as the OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `otlp_endpoint` parameter with the desired endpoint. Alternatively, you can configure the endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

> üí° Info: If you dont provide `otlp_endpoint` function argument or set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable, The OpenLIT SDK directs the trace directly to your console, which can be useful during development.

To send telemetry to OpenTelemetry backends requiring authentication, set the `otlp_headers` parameter with its desired value. Alternatively, you can configure the endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

#### Example

---

<details>
  <summary>Initialize using Function Arguments</summary>

  Add the following two lines to your application code:
  
  ```python
  import openlit
  
  openlit.init(
    otlp_endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4318", 
  )
  ```

</details>

---

<details>

  ---

  <summary>Initialize using Environment Variables</summary>
  
  Add the following two lines to your application code:

  ```python
  import openlit

  openlit.init()
  ```
  
  Then, configure the your OTLP endpoint using environment variable:

  ```env
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:4318"
  ```
</details>

### Step 4: Visualize and Optimize!
With the LLM Observability data now being collected and sent to OpenLIT, the next step is to visualize and analyze this data to get insights into your LLM application's performance, behavior, and identify areas of improvement.
