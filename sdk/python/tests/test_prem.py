This module contains tests for Prem AI functionality using the Prem Python library.

Tests cover various API endpoints, including chat. 
These tests validate integration with OpenLIT.

Environment Variables:
    - PREM_API_KEY: Prem API key for authentication.

Note: Ensure the environment is properly configured for Prem access and OpenLIT monitoring
prior to running these tests.
