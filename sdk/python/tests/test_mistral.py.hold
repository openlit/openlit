Mistral Test Suite

This module contains a suite of tests for Mistral functionality 
using the Mistral Python library. It includes tests for various 
Mistral API endpoints such as text summarization, text generation 
with a prompt,text embeddings creation, and chat-based 
language understanding.

The tests are designed to cover different aspects of Mistral's 
capabilities and serve as a validation mechanism for the integration 
with the Doku monitoring system.

Global Mistral client and initialization are set up for the 
Mistral client and Doku monitoring.

Environment Variables:
    - Mistral_API_TOKEN: Mistral API api_key for authentication.
    - DOKU_URL: Doku URL for monitoring data submission.
    - DOKU_TOKEN: Doku authentication api_key.

Note: Ensure the environment variables are properly set before running the tests.
