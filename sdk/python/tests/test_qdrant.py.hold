"""
This module contains tests for Qdrant functionality using the Qdrant Python library.

Tests cover various API endpoints including collection operations (create, delete),
point operations (upsert, upload, update, delete), payload operations (set, overwrite, clear, delete),
retrieval operations (retrieve, scroll), query operations (query_points, query_points_groups,
query_batch_points), and index management. These tests validate integration with OpenLIT.

Environment Variables:
    - QDRANT_URL: Qdrant Cloud Instance URL.
    - QDRANT_API_TOKEN: Qdrant API api_key for authentication.

Note: Ensure the environment is properly configured for Qdrant access and OpenLIT monitoring
prior to running these tests.

    """
    Tests basic operations within a Qdrant collection.

    This includes creating a new collection, adding points to the collection, modifying payloads and vectors,
    querying the collection, and deleting points. The test verifies correct behavior
    of these operations by asserting expected outcomes at each step.

    - (Commented out) A new collection is created and verified for correct naming.
    - Points are upserted and uploaded to the collection with metadata.
    - Payload operations (set, overwrite, clear, delete) are tested.
    - Vector updates are performed and verified.
    - Query operations are performed, and results are verified.
    - Delete operations target specific points by id.

    The test ensures the basic CRUD operations perform as expected in Qdrant.

    Raises:
      AssertionError: If the responses from Qdrant operations do not meet the expected outcomes.
