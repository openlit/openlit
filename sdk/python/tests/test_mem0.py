This module contains tests for mem0 functionality using the mem0ai Python library.

Tests cover various SDK functions. 
These tests validate integration with OpenLIT.

Environment Variables:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY: OpenAI API key for authentication.

Note: Ensure the environment is properly configured for mem0 and OpenLIT monitoring
prior to running these tests.
