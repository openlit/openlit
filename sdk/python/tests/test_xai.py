"""
This module contains tests for xAI functionality using the OpenAI Python library.

Tests cover various API endpoints, including completions, chat completions,
embeddings, fine-tuning job creation, image generation, image variation creation,
and audio speech generation. These tests validate integration with OpenLIT.

Environment Variables:
    - XAI_API_KEY: xAI API key for authentication.

Note: Ensure the environment is properly configured for xAI access and OpenLIT monitoring
prior to running these tests.
