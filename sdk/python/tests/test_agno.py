This module contains tests for Agno functionality using the Agno Python library.

Tests cover agent execution with Cohere models.
These tests validate integration with OpenLIT.

Environment Variables:
    - CO_API_KEY: Cohere API key for authentication.

Note: Ensure the environment is properly configured for Cohere access and OpenLIT monitoring
prior to running these tests.
