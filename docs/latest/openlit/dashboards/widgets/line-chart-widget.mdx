---

The **Line Chart Widget** in OpenLIT helps you visualize changes in your metrics over time with sharp, precise lines. It’s ideal for tracking KPIs like API latency, CPU usage, conversion rate, or funnel performance.

## When to Use

Use a Line Chart when you want to:

- Monitor trends over time with a high degree of accuracy  
- Display sharp, distinct movements in your data  
- Compare multiple metrics on the same time scale  

## How to Add a Line Chart

Example:

```sql
WITH
	parseDateTimeBestEffort('{{filter.timeLimit.start}}') AS start_time,
	parseDateTimeBestEffort('{{filter.timeLimit.end}}') AS end_time,
	dateDiff('day', start_time, end_time) AS days_diff,
	dateDiff('year', start_time, end_time) AS years_diff,
	multiIf(
	    years_diff >= 1, 'month',
	    days_diff <= 1, 'hour',
	    'day'
	) AS date_granularity
	SELECT
		CAST(COUNT(*) AS INTEGER) AS total,
		formatDateTime(DATE_TRUNC(date_granularity, Timestamp), '%Y/%m/%d %R') AS request_time
	FROM otel_traces
	WHERE
	SpanAttributes['gen_ai.operation.name'] != 'vectordb'
	AND StatusCode IN ('STATUS_CODE_OK', 'STATUS_CODE_UNSET', 'Ok', 'Unset')
	AND Timestamp >= start_time AND Timestamp <= end_time
	GROUP BY request_time
	ORDER BY request_time
````

## Customization Options

* **Custom line colors
* **X/Y label and value paths**

<Tip>
Use dynamic bindings like `{{filter.timeLimit.start}}`, `{{filter.timeLimit.end}}` to make your chart respond to dashboard time filters.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

* Use `GROUP BY` with consistent time buckets (e.g., minute, hour)
* Order your results by time to ensure correct rendering
