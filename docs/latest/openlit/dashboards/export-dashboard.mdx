## What is it?

Dashboard export allows you to save your dashboard configurations as JSON files, preserving all widgets, layouts, queries, and settings. This is essential for:

- **Backup & Recovery**: Create backup copies of important dashboards
- **Team Sharing**: Share proven monitoring setups with team members
- **Environment Migration**: Move dashboards between dev, staging, and production
- **Template Creation**: Build reusable dashboard templates for common use cases
