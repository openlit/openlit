## How it works

OpenLIT dashboards transform your telemetry data into actionable insights through a streamlined process:

1. **Data Collection**: AI telemetry flows through OpenTelemetry instrumentation into ClickHouse
2. **Query Execution**: Widgets execute optimized SQL queries against your telemetry data
3. **Visualization**: Results can be displayed as charts, tables, statistics, and custom visualizations
4. **Interactive Analysis**: Filter, drill down, and explore data with dynamic controls and time ranges
