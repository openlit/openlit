As your dashboard library grows, keeping things organized is key. OpenLIT provides an intuitive folder and board system, along with **drag-and-drop support** to keep your workspace clean and efficient.

You can nest dashboards inside folders and even folders inside other folders to reflect your organizational structure.

<Tip>
**Organization best practices:**
- Use consistent naming patterns: e.g., `Product > Retention`, `Infra > API Latency`
- Pin frequently used dashboards for quick access
- Set the most visited dashboard as your [Main Dashboard →](/latest/openlit/dashboards/set-main-dashboard)
- Combine folders and boards for deeply nested structures like `Engineering > Backend > Metrics > Error Logs`
