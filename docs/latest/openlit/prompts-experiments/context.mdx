title: 'Context'
description: 'Store and manage reusable contextual content that can be linked to rules and retrieved at runtime'
---

Context lets you store rich, reusable content — such as system prompts, knowledge snippets, policy documents, or any markdown text — and associate it with rules in the Rule Engine. When a rule matches at evaluation time, the linked context data is returned alongside the result, ready to be injected into your AI pipeline.

## Key features

- **Markdown content**: Write and preview context content in a full Write/Preview markdown editor.
- **Tags**: Categorise contexts with free-form tags for easy filtering and discovery.
- **Meta properties**: Attach arbitrary key-value metadata to contexts (e.g. `model: gpt-4`, `region: us`).
- **Status control**: Mark contexts as **Active** or **Inactive** to enable or disable them without deletion.
- **Rule linking**: Associate contexts with one or more rules. When a rule matches, linked context content is returned in the evaluate API response.

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="List contexts">
    Get an overview of all contexts created.
    1. Navigate to **Context** in the OpenLIT sidebar.
    2. Browse the list of existing contexts with their status and description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a context">
    1. Click **Create Context** in the top-right corner.
    2. Enter a **Name** (required) and an optional **Description**.
    3. Write your content in the **Content** editor. Markdown is fully supported — switch to **Preview** to see the rendered output.
    4. On the right panel:
       - Set the **Status** to *Active* or *Inactive*.
       - Add **Tags** by typing and pressing Enter.
       - Add **Meta Properties** as key-value pairs for additional metadata.
    5. Click **Save Context**. You will be redirected to the context detail page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit a context">
    1. Click on any context in the list to open its detail page.
    2. Click **Edit** to switch to edit mode.
    3. Modify any fields — name, description, content, status, tags, or meta properties.
    4. Click **Save** to apply changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link a context to a rule">
    Contexts become actionable when linked to rules.
    1. Open the context detail page.
    2. In the **Linked Rules** panel on the right, click **New Rule** to create and link a new rule, or use **Link existing rule** to associate an existing rule.
    3. Linked rules are listed with their name and status. Click a rule name to navigate to its detail page.

    Alternatively, from the Context list page, click the **rule icon** (⧉) on any row to quickly create a rule linked to that context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve context data at runtime">
    Use the Rule Engine evaluate API to fetch matching context data for your AI pipeline.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an API Key">
        - Navigate to **Settings → API Keys** in OpenLIT.
        - Click **Create API Key**, enter a name, and save the key securely.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call the evaluate API">
        Send a `POST` request to `/api/rule-engine/evaluate` with your input fields and `entity_type: "context"`.

        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://your-openlit-instance/api/rule-engine/evaluate \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "entity_type": "context",
            "fields": {
              "model": "gpt-4",
              "user_tier": "premium"
            },
            "include_entity_data": true
          }'
        ```

        ```json Response
        {
          "matchingRuleIds": ["rule-uuid-1"],
          "entities": [
            {
              "rule_id": "rule-uuid-1",
              "entity_type": "context",
              "entity_id": "context-uuid-1"
            }
          ],
          "entity_data": {
            "context:context-uuid-1": {
              "id": "context-uuid-1",
              "name": "Premium System Prompt",
              "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant for premium users...",
              "tags": "[\"premium\",\"system\"]",
              "status": "ACTIVE"
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        Set `include_entity_data: true` to receive the full context record. When omitted, only matching rule IDs and entity references are returned.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete a context">
    1. Open the context detail page.
    2. Click the **Delete** button.
    3. Confirm deletion. This action is permanent.
  </Step>
</Steps>
