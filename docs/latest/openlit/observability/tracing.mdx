The OpenLIT platform provides comprehensive trace visualization capabilities. You can view traces in two ways:

1. **Traces Page**: Navigate to the **Traces** section at `127.0.0.1:3000/traces` to view all distributed traces from your AI applications with detailed span analysis and execution flow.

2. **Dashboard Widgets**: Create custom trace widgets in your dashboards to monitor specific trace metrics, latency trends, and performance insights alongside other observability data.
