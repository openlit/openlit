The OpenLIT platform allows you to view OpenTelemetry metrics sent from your AI applications through **Dashboard Widgets**. While there's no dedicated metrics explorer page, you can create comprehensive dashboards with customizable widgets to visualize the metrics data stored in ClickHouse, including LLM performance, cost analysis, token usage, and system health metrics.

Navigate to the **Dashboards** section to build personalized metric widgets with various chart types, filters, and real-time visualization of your OpenTelemetry metrics data.
