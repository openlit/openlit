Organisations in OpenLIT let you group team members under a shared workspace, each connected to its own ClickHouse database configuration. All resources — dashboards, prompts, rules, contexts, and secrets — are scoped per organisation, giving teams full isolation and control.

## Key features

- **Workspace isolation**: Each organisation maintains its own database configuration and resource space.
- **Role-based access control**: Assign **Admin** or **Member** roles to control who can manage settings and invite others.
- **Email invitations**: Invite teammates by email. Invitations can be accepted or declined from the notification panel.
- **Multiple organisations**: A single user can belong to multiple organisations and switch between them at any time.
- **Member management**: Admins can view all members, update roles, and remove users from the organisation.
