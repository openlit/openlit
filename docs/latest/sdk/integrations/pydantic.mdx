OpenLIT uses OpenTelemetry Auto-Instrumentation to help you monitor AI Agents built using Pydantic AI. This includes tracking performance and operation stats.

Auto-instrumentation means you don't have to set up monitoring manually for different LLMs, frameworks, or databases. By simply adding OpenLIT in your application, all the necessary monitoring configurations are automatically set up.

The integration is compatible with  
- Pydantic AI Python SDK client `>= 0.2.17`
