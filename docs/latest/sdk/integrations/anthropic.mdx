OpenLIT uses OpenTelemetry Auto-Instrumentation to help you monitor LLM applications built using Anthropic models. This includes tracking performance, token usage, costs, and how users interact with the application.

Auto-instrumentation means you don't have to set up monitoring manually for different LLMs, frameworks, or databases. By simply adding OpenLIT in your application, all the necessary monitoring configurations are automatically set up.

The integration is compatible with  
- Anthropic Python SDK client `>= 0.21.0` 
- Anthropic Typescript SDK client `>= 0.21.0`
