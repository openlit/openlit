OpenLIT uses OpenTelemetry Auto-Instrumentation to help you monitor LLM applications built using OLA Krutrim models. This includes tracking performance, token usage, costs, and how users interact with the application.

Auto-instrumentation means you don't have to set up monitoring manually for different LLMs, frameworks, or databases. By simply adding OpenLIT in your application, all the necessary monitoring configurations are automatically set up.

As Krutrim uses the OpenAI SDK, This integration is compatible with  
- OpenAI Python SDK client `>=1.13.0`
