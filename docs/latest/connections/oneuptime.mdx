    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Setup using function arguments">
      ```python
      import openlit

      openlit.init(
        otlp_endpoint="https://otlp.oneuptime.com", 
        otlp_headers="x-oneuptime-token=YOUR_ONEUPTIME_SERVICE_TOKEN"
      )
      ```

      Replace:
      1. `YOUR_ONEUPTIME_SERVICE_TOKEN` with the OneUptime Ingestion Key value you copied in Step 1. 

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Setup using Environment Variables">
      ```python
      import openlit

      openlit.init()
      ```

      Run the following command to configure the OTEL endpoint and headers to send metrics and traces to OneUptime:
      ```shell
      export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "https://otlp.oneuptime.com"
      export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS = "x-oneuptime-token=YOUR_ONEUPTIME_SERVICE_TOKEN"
      ```

      Replace:
      1. `YOUR_ONEUPTIME_SERVICE_TOKEN` with the OneUptime Ingestion Key` value you copied in Step 1. 
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  Refer to the OpenLIT [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/python) for more advanced configurations and use cases.
