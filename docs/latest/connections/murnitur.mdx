To send OpenTelemetry data collected by OpenLIt from your LLM Application, You need to set the `otlp_endpoint` and `otlp_headers` arguments according to your needs.

```python
import openlit

openlit.init(
    otlp_endpoint="https://middleware.murnitur.ai",
    otlp_headers=f"x-murnix-trace-token={murnitur_api_key}",
    disable_metrics=True,
)
```

Visit [Murnitur.ai](https://murnitur.ai) to generate your API key.

Alternatively, you can configure the OTLP endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and the OTLP headers by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

Refer to the OpenLIT [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/python) for more advanced configurations and use cases.
