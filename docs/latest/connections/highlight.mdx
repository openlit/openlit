To directly send OpenTelemetry data collected by OpenLIT SDK from your AI Application to Highlight.io, You need to set the `otlp_endpoint` and `otlp_headers` arguments according to your needs.

```python
import openlit

openlit.init(otlp_endpoint="otlp_backend_endpoint", otlp_headers="otlp_backend_token")
```

Alternatively, you can configure the OTLP endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and the OTLP headers by setting the Appli`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environmentcation variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

Refer to the OpenLIT [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/python) for more advanced configurations and use cases.
