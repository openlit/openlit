To send OpenTelemetry metrics and traces generated by OpenLIT from your LLM Application to HyperDX, Follow the below steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install OpenTelemetry Collector (Optional)">
    This step is optional if you have the OpenTelemetry Collector already running.

    For detailed installation instructions for the OpenTelemetry Collector , please refer to the [OpenTelemetry Collector Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/). This guide provides comprehensive steps to get you up and running with the Collector on various platforms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector">

    1. **Configure HTTP Receiver**: In the `receivers` section of your OpenTelemetry Collector config, ensure the `http` receiver is set with `endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318`.
        ```yaml
        receivers:
          otlp:
            protocols:
              http:
                endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
        ```

    2. **Define Exporters**: Add `otlp` exporter to export metrics and traces to HyperDX.
        ```yaml
        exporters:
          # HTTP setup
          otlphttp/hdx:
            endpoint: 'https://in-otel.hyperdx.io'
            headers:
            authorization: YOUR_HYPERDX_API_KEY_HERE
            compression: gzip

          # gRPC setup (alternative)
          otlp/hdx:
            endpoint: 'in-otel.hyperdx.io:4317'
            headers:
            authorization: YOUR_HYPERDX_API_KEY_HERE
            compression: gzip
        ```
        Replace:
        1. `YOUR_HYPERDX_API_KEY_HERE` with the your HyperDX API Key. 
            * Example - `x6xx7265-43x3-476x-1112-x9x52x29xxxx`

    3. **Assign Exporters to Pipelines**: Link `otlphttp/hdx` to `service.pipelines.traces` and `service.pipelines.metrics` for data export.
        ```yaml
        service:
          pipelines:
            traces:
              receivers: [ otlp ]
              exporters: [ otlphttp/hdx ]
            metrics:
              receivers: [ otlp ]
              exporters: [ otlphttp/hdx ]
        ```
    
    **Complete Configuration Example**
    <Accordion title="Example Configuration">
    ```yaml
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:

          http:
            endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

    processors:
      batch:
      memory_limiter:
        # 80% of maximum memory up to 2G
        limit_mib: 1500
        # 25% of limit up to 2G
        spike_limit_mib: 512
        check_interval: 5s

    exporters:
      otlphttp/hdx:
        endpoint: 'https://in-otel.hyperdx.io'
        headers:

        compression: gzip

    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [ otlp ]
          processors: [ memory_limiter, batch ]
          exporters: [ otlphttp/hdx ]
        metrics:
          receivers: [ otlp ]
          processors: [ memory_limiter, batch ]
          exporters: [ otlphttp/hdx ]
    ```

  <Step title="Add the following two lines to your application code:">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Setup using function arguments">
      ```python
      import openlit

      openlit.init(
        otlp_endpoint="YOUR_OTELCOL_URL:4318", 
      )
      ```

      Replace:
      1. `YOUR_OTELCOL_URL:4318` with the URL HTTP endpoint of your OpenTelemetry Collector. 
         * Example - `http://127.0.0.1:4318`
      
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Setup using Environment Variables">
      ```python
      import openlit

      openlit.init()
      ```

      Run the following command to configure the OTEL endpoint and headers to send metrics and traces to Grafana Cloud:
      ```shell
      export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "YOUR_OTELCOL_URL:4318"
      ```

      Replace:
      1. `YOUR_OTELCOL_URL:4318` with the URL HTTP endpoint of your OpenTelemetry Collector. 
        * Example - `http://127.0.0.1:4318`
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  Refer to the OpenLIT [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/python) for more advanced configurations and use cases.
