To directly send OpenTelemetry data collected by OpenLIT SDK from your AI Application to OpenTelemetry Collector, You need to set the `otlp_endpoint` and `otlp_headers` arguments according to your needs.

```python
import openlit

openlit.init(otlp_endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4318")
```

Alternatively, you can configure the OTLP endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and the OTLP headers by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`(Optional) environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

Refer to the OpenLIT [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/python) for more advanced configurations and use cases.
