OpenLIT Operator is an open-source observability control plane for AI applications. OpenLIT leverages the power of OpenTelemetry to automatically instrument AI applications and produces distributed traces, metrics, and costs **without any code changes**. The operator automatically injects and configures instrumentation according to your application requirements.

The name OpenLIT originates from "Open" observability for "LIT" (Language, Intelligence, Technology).

## Goals

* **Automatic instrumentation** - OpenLIT automatically instruments your AI applications and produces distributed traces, metrics, and costs **without any code changes**.
* **Instrumentation management** - OpenLIT automatically injects and configures instrumentation according to your application requirements. No need to spend time manually instrumenting each application.
* **Provider flexibility** - Support for multiple instrumentation providers (OpenLIT, OpenInference, OpenLLMetry) with easy switching capabilities.

OpenLIT achieves its goals by deploying a set of components that work together to inject, configure, and manage telemetry collection from your AI applications.

## Who is OpenLIT Operator for?

* **AI/ML Engineers** - Building and deploying AI applications in Kubernetes
* **Platform Engineers** - Managing observability infrastructure for AI workloads  
* **DevOps Teams** - Operating AI applications in production environments
* **Software Developers** - Building applications with LLMs and AI frameworks
* **Anyone comfortable with Kubernetes** - Basic knowledge of pods, deployments, and kubectl

OpenLIT Operator is designed to be easy to use and deploy. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to get started with AI observability without the hassle of manually instrumenting each application.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Operator">
    Deploy OpenLIT Operator to your Kubernetes cluster using Helm
    ```bash
    helm install openlit-operator openlit/openlit-operator \
      --create-namespace --namespace openlit
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create AutoInstrumentation">
    Define which applications to instrument using Custom Resources
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: openlit.io/v1alpha1
    kind: AutoInstrumentation
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          openlit.io/instrument: "true"
      otlp:
        endpoint: "http://openlit:4318"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Label Your Applications">
    Add labels to your AI application pods to enable instrumentation
    ```yaml
    labels:
      openlit.io/instrument: "true"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Observability">
    Your applications automatically emit traces, metrics, and costs without any code changes
  </Step>
</Steps>
