OpenLIT uses OpenTelemetry to help you monitor NVIDIA GPUs. This includes tracking GPU metrics like utilization, temperature, memory usage and power consumption.

## Get Started

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Install OpenLIT">
          Open your command line or terminal and run:
          ```shell
          pip install openlit
          ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Initialize OpenLIT in your Application">
        You can set up OpenLIT in your application using either function arguments directly in your code or by using environment variables.
        <Tabs>
          <Tab title="Setup using function arguments">

          Add the following two lines to your application code:

          ```python
          import openlit

          openlit.init(
            otlp_endpoint="YOUR_OTEL_ENDPOINT", otlp_headers="YOUR_OTEL_HEADERS"
            collect_gpu_stats=True 
          )
          ```

          Replace:
          1. `YOUR_OTEL_ENDPOINT` with the URL of your OpenTelemetry backend, such as `http://127.0.0.1:4318` if you are using OpenLIT and a local OTel Collector.
          </Tab>
          <Tab title="Setup using Environment Variables">
          
          Add the following two lines to your application code:

          ```python
          import openlit

          openlit.init(collect_gpu_stats=True)
          ```

          Then, configure the your OTLP endpoint using environment variable:
          ```shell
          export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "YOUR_OTEL_ENDPOINT"
          export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS= "YOUR_OTEL_HEADERS"
          ```

          Replace:
          1. `YOUR_OTEL_ENDPOINT` with the URL of your OpenTelemetry backend, such as `http://127.0.0.1:4318` if you are using OpenLIT and a local OTel Collector. 
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        To send metrics to other Observability tools, refer to the [Connections Guide](/latest/connections/intro).

    <Step title="Pull `otel-gpu-collector` Docker Image">

        You can quickly start using the OTel GPU Collector by pulling the Docker image:

        ```sh
        docker pull ghcr.io/openlit/otel-gpu-collector:latest
        ```
     </Step>
     <Step title="Run `otel-gpu-collector` Docker container">

        You can quickly start using the OTel GPU Collector by pulling the Docker image:
        Here's a quick example showing how to run the container with the required environment variables:

        ```sh
        docker run --gpus all \
            -e GPU_APPLICATION_NAME='chatbot' \
            -e GPU_ENVIRONMENT='staging' \
            -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="YOUR_OTEL_ENDPOINT" \
            -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="YOUR_OTEL_HEADERS" \
            ghcr.io/openlit/otel-gpu-collector:latest
        ```

        For more advanced configurations of the collector, visit the [OTel GPU Collector repository](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/otel-gpu-collector/).
