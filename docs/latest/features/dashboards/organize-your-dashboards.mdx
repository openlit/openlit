## 📁 Use Folders and Dashboards

Dashboards can be placed inside:
- **Folders** – Great for grouping dashboards by team, project, or function.
- **Dashboards** – Containers that hold folders or dashboards directly. These often represent high-level categories like “Product,” “Infra,” or “Finance.”

You can nest dashboards inside folders and even folders inside other folders to reflect your organizational structure.
