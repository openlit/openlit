title: Auto Refresh & Time Interval
description: Learn how to enable auto-refresh and set time intervals in OpenLIT dashboards to keep your data live and updated in real time.
---

You can configure OpenLIT dashboards to automatically refresh data at set intervals. This feature is essential for live monitoring dashboards, status boards, and any view that requires up-to-date metrics from ClickHouse.

---

## 🧠 Why Use Refresh Intervals?

Refresh intervals allow you to:
- Keep data fresh without manual reloads and automatically re-run queries behind the scenes  
- Power live dashboards for operations and support teams  
- Monitor real-time metrics

Once set, the dashboard will automatically re-fetch data from ClickHouse at the selected interval.

Snippet to make use of the time interval in the query:

```sql
WHERE event_time BETWEEN {{filter.timeLimit.start}} AND {{filter.timeLimit.end}}
```

<Tip>
Use shorter intervals only for optimized queries. Long-running queries + high refresh rates can overload your ClickHouse backend.
</Tip>

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use dynamic bindings like `{{filter.timeLimit.start}}`, `{{filter.timeLimit.end}}` to make your chart respond to dashboard time filters. 
- Avoid using `LIMIT 1000` or wide result sets on high-frequency updates  
- Use refresh intervals in combination with pinned dashboards for kiosk or ops setups
