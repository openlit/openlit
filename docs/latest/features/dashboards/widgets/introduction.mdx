title: 'Getting Started with Widgets'
---

Widgets are the core building blocks of dashboards in OpenLIT. Each widget connects to a ClickHouse query, allowing you to visualize data in different formatsâ€”from charts to tables, counters, and text.
You can configure styling, bind parameters (like time ranges or filters), and arrange widgets freely in your dashboard layout.
Widgets can be:
- Visual (e.g., charts)
- Informational (e.g., stats, markdown)
- Data-centric (e.g., tables)

Here are the list of supported widgets :
