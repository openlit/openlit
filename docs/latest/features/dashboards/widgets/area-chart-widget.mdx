## 📌 When to Use

Use the Area Chart when you want to:

- Show trends over time  
- Emphasize volume or scale changes  
- Display multiple series stacked

Area charts are particularly effective for metrics that accumulate or change gradually over time.

## 📊 Example: 

```sql
WITH
	parseDateTimeBestEffort('{{filter.timeLimit.start}}') AS start_time,
	parseDateTimeBestEffort('{{filter.timeLimit.end}}') AS end_time,
	dateDiff('day', start_time, end_time) AS days_diff,
	dateDiff('year', start_time, end_time) AS years_diff,
	multiIf(
	    years_diff >= 1, 'month',
	    days_diff <= 1, 'hour',
	    'day'
	) AS date_granularity  
	
	SELECT 
		CAST(SUM(toInt64OrZero(SpanAttributes['gen_ai.usage.input_tokens'])) AS INTEGER) AS prompt_tokens, 
		CAST(SUM(toInt64OrZero(SpanAttributes['gen_ai.usage.output_tokens'])) AS INTEGER) AS completion_tokens, 
		formatDateTime(DATE_TRUNC(date_granularity, Timestamp), '%Y/%m/%d %R') AS request_time 
	FROM otel_traces  
	WHERE  
		SpanAttributes['gen_ai.operation.name'] != 'vectordb' 
		AND StatusCode IN ('STATUS_CODE_OK', 'STATUS_CODE_UNSET', 'Ok', 'Unset') 
		AND Timestamp >= start_time 
		AND Timestamp <= end_time 
	GROUP BY request_time 
	ORDER BY request_time;

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

Customize your Area Chart with the following options:

* **X-Axis**: A path to label or the group by param
* **Y-Axes**: An array of value path and color combination

<Tip>
Use dynamic bindings like `{{filter.timeLimit.start}}`, `{{filter.timeLimit.end}}` to make your chart respond to dashboard time filters.
</Tip>

## ✅ Best Practices

* Limit the number of series to keep the chart readable.
* Apply consistent color palettes for related metrics.
* Use filters (`{{filter.timeLimit.start}}`, `{{filter.timeLimit.end}}`) to enable dynamic dashboards
