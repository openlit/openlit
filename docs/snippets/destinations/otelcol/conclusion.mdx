### 3. Configure Collector Exporters

Once your LLM application is sending data to the OpenTelemetry Collector, configure exporters to send data to your preferred observability backends:

**Popular Exporter Configurations**:

<Accordion title="Jaeger (Traces)">
```yaml
exporters:
  jaeger:
    endpoint: http://jaeger-collector:14250
    tls:
      insecure: false

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [jaeger]
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prometheus (Metrics)">
```yaml
exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"
    metric_expiration: 180m

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [prometheus]
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiple Backends">
```yaml
exporters:
  otlp/backend1:
    endpoint: http://backend1:4317
  otlp/backend2:
    endpoint: http://backend2:4317
  logging:
    loglevel: debug

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/backend1, otlp/backend2, logging]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/backend1, otlp/backend2]
```
</Accordion>

**Monitor Collector Health**:
```bash
# Check collector logs
docker logs <collector-container-id>

# Or for Kubernetes
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=opentelemetry-collector

# Health check endpoint (if enabled)
curl http://localhost:13133/
```

**Benefits of Using OpenTelemetry Collector**:
- **Vendor Agnostic**: Route data to multiple backends simultaneously
- **Data Processing**: Apply transformations, filtering, and sampling
- **Protocol Translation**: Convert between different telemetry formats
- **Buffering & Reliability**: Handle network issues and backend outages
- **Cost Optimization**: Sample and filter data to reduce costs
- **Security**: Add authentication, encryption, and data anonymization

Your OpenLIT-instrumented AI applications will send telemetry data to the Collector, which can then process and route it to any number of observability backends, providing flexibility and powerful data processing capabilities for your LLM monitoring infrastructure.
