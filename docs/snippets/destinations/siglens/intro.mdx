To send OpenTelemetry metrics and traces generated by OpenLIT from your AI Application to SigLens, follow the below steps.

### 1. Get your SigLens Endpoint

1. **Ensure SigLens is running**: Make sure your SigLens instance is deployed and accessible
2. **Get the OTLP endpoint**: SigLens accepts OTLP data on port 4318
   - **Local deployment**: `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`
   - **Remote deployment**: `http://<your-siglens-host>:4318/v1/traces`
   - Replace `<your-siglens-host>` with your SigLens server address

<Note>
SigLens supports direct OTLP ingestion without additional authentication for basic setups.
