### 3. View your telemetry in Dash0

Once your AI application starts sending telemetry data, you can explore it in Dash0:

1. **Traces**: Navigate to Traces to view your AI application traces with LLM calls, prompts, completions, and token usage
1. **Services**: Check Services to monitor your AI service performance, error rates, and latency
1. **Metrics**: Explore metrics for token usage, costs, and AI-specific KPIs
1. **Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards to track token consumption, model performance, and business metrics
1. **Query**: Use PromQL-based queries to filter and analyze telemetry by model, token usage, or errors

Your OpenLIT-instrumented AI applications will appear automatically in Dash0 with comprehensive observability including LLM costs, token usage, model performance, and GPU metrics.
