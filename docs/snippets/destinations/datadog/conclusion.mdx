### 3. Exploring Telemetry in DataDog

Once your AI application is sending telemetry data to DataDog, you can explore and analyze it using DataDog's powerful observability features:

#### Software Catalog
View all your AI services and their connections:
- Go to **APM** → **Software Catalog**
- Select **Map** to see how services are connected
- Change **Map layout** to **Cluster** or **Flow** for different views
- Select **Catalog** view, then click a service for performance summary

#### Trace Explorer  
Explore traces from your AI applications:
- Navigate to **Performance** → **Setup Guidance** → **View Traces**
- Select an indexed span to view full trace details
- View correlated data across tabs:
  - Infrastructure metrics for services with Host Metrics
  - Runtime metrics for implemented services  
  - Log entries correlated with traces
  - Span links connected to traces

<Note>
After your OpenLIT-instrumented AI application starts sending data, it may take a few minutes for traces and metrics to appear in DataDog. The built-in telemetry generation will begin automatically once your application processes AI requests.
