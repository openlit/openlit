To send OpenTelemetry metrics generated by OpenLIT from your AI Application to Oodle, follow the below steps.

### 1. Get your Oodle Credentials

1. **Sign in to your Oodle account**
2. **Get your Oodle credentials**:
   - **OODLE_ENDPOINT**: Your Oodle metrics ingestion endpoint
   - **INSTANCE_ID**: Your Oodle instance identifier
   - **API_KEY**: Your Oodle API key for authentication

<Note>
Oodle currently supports **metrics only**. Traces are not yet supported and will be handled by a debug exporter.
</Note>

### 2. Configure OpenTelemetry Collector

**Install OpenTelemetry Collector** (if not already running):
For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [OpenTelemetry Collector Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/).

**Configure the Collector** for Oodle integration:

<Accordion title="Complete Collector Configuration">
```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

  otlphttp/oodle:
    metrics_endpoint: "https://OODLE_ENDPOINT/v1/otlp/metrics/INSTANCE_ID"
    headers:
      X-API-KEY: "API_KEY"
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed
    sampling_initial: 5
    sampling_thereafter: 200

    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
```
</Accordion>

Replace:
1. `OODLE_ENDPOINT` with your Oodle endpoint
2. `INSTANCE_ID` with your Oodle instance ID  
3. `API_KEY` with your Oodle API key
