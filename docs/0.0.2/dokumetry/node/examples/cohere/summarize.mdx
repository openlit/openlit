## Summarize

```javascript
const { CohereClient } = require("cohere-ai");
import DokuMetry from 'dokumetry';

const cohere = new CohereClient({
    token: "<<apiKey>>",
});

// Pass the above `cohere` object along with your DOKU URL and API key and this will make sure that all Cohere calls are automatically tracked.
DokuMetry.init({llm: cohere, dokuUrl: "YOUR_DOKU_URL", apiKey: "YOUR_DOKU_TOKEN"})

(async () => {
  const summarize = await cohere.summarize({
      text: "Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. "
          + "It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, "
          + "either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, "
          + "or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. "
          + "It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. "
          + "Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. "
          + "The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces "
          + "and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, "
          + "semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). "
          + "It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.\n\n"
          + "The meaning of the name \"ice cream\" varies from one country to another. "
          + "In some countries, such as the United States, \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety, "
          + "and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the "
          + "relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. "
          + "Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled "
          + "\"frozen dairy dessert\" instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, "
          + "one word is used fo\r all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, "
          + "such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes "
          + "(e.g., soy, cashew, coconut, almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are "
          + "lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein or vegan.",
